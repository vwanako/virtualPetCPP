# virtualPetCPP
This project was made to improve my C++ skills and to practice OOP. It's a simple virtual pet program (inspired by the old Tamagotchi toys) in which the user can feed, play, clean and put their pet to sleep. 
Currently, I don't plan on finishing this project in C++ as I want to add visual elements and make it into a real game, so I will continue developing it using C# and the Unity game engine.
